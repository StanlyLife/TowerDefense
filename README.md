# TowerDefense
#### Tower defense game made with unity and C#

this is the third game i have made with C# and untiy. it was originaly made to learn the basics and challenges
of making a tower defense game before making a bigger and better 3D version with multiple maps and challenges.

there was alot of problems that i encountered underways, eg:
1. how to turn the head of the towers towards the road
2. how to find enemies within range of the tower
3. blocking placement ontop of the road and other towers

all the problems were quickly solved but after a while i wanted to be able to right click a tower
to upgrade, sell and/or move it, thats when i realised the architecture of the entire project 
started turning into spaghetti. After troubleshooting for a while i realised it was impossible due to
a bug within unity. there was a workaround i could do, but it would require me to rebuild all the towers and alot of the code.
again, the code would've had to be rebuilt due to the lack of SRP and not following the SOLID fundaments that i
started learning underways.

I have learned alot building this game and will probably try making another one in the future. but my next step will
be towards writing clean code and using clean architecture aswell as eventually learning the .Net framework for c#.
